# Introduction
## What is ABI-Smartly

ABI-Smartly is a platform that makes it easy for frontend engineers to integrate with smart contract ABIs. No more struggling with Solidity - **Just use ABI-Smartly and get back to building great DAPPs ‚ö°Ô∏èü§üüèª** Practice your web3 skills, join the open-source community, and simplify the overwhelming world of blockchain.

### What you'll need

 *Before you move further, it'd be nice to have known some of the concept, so as to help you go straight into integrating your dapps with the ABI's on our platform.*

- Understanding a Javascript framework: (**React, Vue, Angular**)
- **Web3js Libraries:** there are couple of libraries out there that make it easy to interact with the blockchain from the client side.
  - [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/).
  - [Ether.js](https://docs.ethers.org/)
- Having a basic knowledge of how wallet works: [Cryptocurrency wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQyg9pyJ1Ac)

## Our greatest goal for you

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

1. The blockchain ecosystem can be overwhelming, with a lot of resources to navigate. ABI-Smartly simplifies this process and takes away the stress of trying to understand the details.
2. Join the open-source community on ABI-Smartly and share your **smart contract ABIs** with fellow developers to build amazing interfaces for it. code credits attached - it's the platform built by developers, for developers.

3. This is a platform where developers can collaborate on open-source projects and showcase their skills to the world, you never know who's watching üòâ.

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Conclusion

I hope this little intro has been able to help you spark that imaginative mind and also pushed you into getting into open source as a noob/expert ü•Ç.
